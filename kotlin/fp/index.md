# In summary

- Core concepts built-in
- Leverage Java ecosystem
- Will run everywhere
- Kotlin is a language for the ultraverse

Note:
    Immutability, nullability, coroutines, flow, reactive streams, DSLs, etc.
    
    When letting CoPilot autocomplete it suggested 'for the ultraverse' as the final completion.
